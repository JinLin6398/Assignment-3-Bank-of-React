## Project Description: 
The Bank of React is a website built with React that simulates a simple banking experience where users can manage their account balance by viewing and adding credits and debits. The project uses React concepts, such as client-side routing with React Router, state management, and data flow. Users can navigate easily between pages like Home, Credits, Debits, User Profile, and Login, while also viewing and updating their account balance. The use of API integration helps us get initial credit and debit data, improving the functionality and providing hands-on experience in React development.
